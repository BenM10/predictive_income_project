# Executive Summary

This project examines binary income classification using the UCI Adult (1994 US Census) dataset. The objective is to predict whether an individual’s annual income exceeds $50,000 based on demographic and employment-related attributes. Such classification problems are common in socioeconomic research and financial risk modelling, where income level serves as a proxy for economic stability.

The workflow combined exploratory data analysis with a structured preprocessing pipeline, including targeted log transformations and categorical encoding. A range of models were evaluated, spanning logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, and a neural network baseline. Performance was assessed primarily using ROC AUC and the F1-score for the minority (>50K) class to ensure robustness under class imbalance.

HistGradientBoostingClassifier achieved the strongest validation performance, with a ROC AUC of 0.9325 and an F1-score of 0.724. Ensemble methods consistently outperformed linear and single-tree approaches, indicating the importance of modelling nonlinear interactions. Exploratory Principal Component Analysis further suggested moderate high-dimensional structure within the feature space. Nevertheless, the age of the dataset and the fixed binary income threshold limit direct contemporary generalisation.
